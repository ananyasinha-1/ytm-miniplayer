## 📖 Project Purpose

YouTube Music is great, but managing playback while coding or studying often means hunting through dozens of open tabs. **YTM Mini Mode** solves this by adding a native toggle button directly to the YouTube Music interface. 

With one click, your music pops out into a clean, responsive, and persistent mini-window. Click it again, and it seamlessly pops back into your main browser window without interrupting playback.

### ✨ Features
* **Seamless Window Management:** Pop the player out into a mini-window, or pop it back into your main browser session.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized CSS ensures album art and song titles scale perfectly.
* **Privacy First:** No tracking, no data collection. 

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using:
* **Vanilla JavaScript** & **CSS**
* **webextension-polyfill** for cross-browser API compatibility.
* **Manifest V3** (Chrome) and **Manifest V2** (Firefox).
* **Bash** for standard build automation without heavy webpack/bundlers.
* **ESLint** & **Prettier** for code formatting and standardisation.

## 💻 Local Setup Instructions

These instructions have been designed and tested for a clean local machine environment.

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18+ recommended)
* `npm` (comes with Node.js)
* Git

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Labreo/ytm-miniplayer.git
   cd ytm-miniplayer
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies:**
   This project uses npm purely for linting, formatting, and polyfills.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the extension:**
   Generate the clean, store-ready browser distributions:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Or run directly: bash build.sh
   ```
   *This will create a `dist/` directory containing `chrome/`, `firefox/`, and `edge/` builds.*

4. **Load the extension manually into your browser:**
   * **For Chrome:** Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, toggle on "Developer mode" in the top right, click "Load unpacked", and select the `dist/chrome/` folder.
   * **For Edge:** Navigate to `edge://extensions/`, toggle on "Developer mode", click "Load unpacked", and select `dist/edge/`.
   * **For Firefox:** Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click "Load Temporary Add-on", and select the `manifest.json` inside the `dist/firefox/` folder.

## 🪟 Windows Setup Notes

Windows users may face issues while setting up the extension locally because the project uses bash scripts and Linux utilities.

### Recommended Setup
- Install Git for Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Use Git Bash instead of Command Prompt
- Install Node.js (v18+ recommended)

### Running the Build
Run the following commands inside Git Bash:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Common Issues

#### `bash build.sh` not working
This project uses bash scripts which may not work correctly in Command Prompt or PowerShell. Use Git Bash instead.

#### `zip: command not found`
Some Windows environments may not include the `zip` utility by default.

#### Missing `manifest.chrome.json`
The build script references `manifest.chrome.json` during the Chrome and Edge build process.

### Loading the Extension
After building:
- Open `chrome://extensions`
- Enable Developer Mode
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Select the `dist/chrome` folder
